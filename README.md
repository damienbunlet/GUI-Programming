# GUI-Programming
School project - GUI Programming 

***

To run this project, you need to install Node.js on your computer.
You can find it on this [link](https://nodejs.org/).

***

After the installation of Node, you need to open a terminal at the same place of "app.js" file and enter this command:
> ``npm install``

This command will install all the necessary dependencies to run the application correctly.

***

Once that is done, you can launch the application by entering the following command:
> ``node app.js``

***

Go to your web browser and write in address bar: 
> localhost:8080

***

Now, you can navigate between different projects.
